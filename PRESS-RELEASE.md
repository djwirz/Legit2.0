There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Academic outcomes tracking & data management App. Name TBD
## Sub-Heading ##
   Giving educators an intutive, easy to use means of tracking student outcomes.
## Summary ##
Outcomes tracking & data management application for teachers and educators. Inputs, retrieves, and edits data posted to a relational database system. Teachers will create accounts, log in, create and edit information for their classes and define new ones, link their classes to rosters containing student data, and create and grade assignments. All content creation is aligned with Common Core standards. Dashboards summarizing data are generalized by class, student, and assignment outcomes.
At the bare minimum the app will provide a high degree of flexibility for teachers to create and manage assignments and outcomes data for their classes. This system should allow teachers to define custom fields for their class and assignment schema, linking classes to student rosters, and assignments to classes. As student data will be provided for each class as a roster with pre-compiled records, editing student information falls outside the scope of this application (though a teacher would likely benefit from the ability to store notes for each of their students). Information for classes, assignments, and students - including custom fields generated by teachers - will feed the application’s reporting and outcomes dashboards.
The dashboards will summarize student outcomes - to do so, they must reference some mathematical formulas for averages and longitudinal performance. Once this is possible, outcomes data can be compared across classes and assignments (being not proper to draw comparisons between individual students?)

This should will be a components-based system that is extensible without requiring modifications to the core functionality; once the MVP is operating, modules providing data visualization, API integration, and real-time messaging can be introduced as “extras”.

## Problem ##
In today’s education space most educators utilize spreadsheet software to manage student outcomes,  spreadsheet applications require a specific skillset in order to visualize data and are also inherently time consuming. We feel teachers should be focused on teaching not data entry. 
## Solution ##
Our product simplifies the process of student outcomes tracking, providing the user with an intuitive, intelligent and customizable interface that takes away the pain associated with using spreadsheet software. 

## Quote from You ##
Empowering educators by  bringing  smart data within reach.

## How to Get Started ##
 Sign up and setup is simple, once a  user account is created the application will automatically populate class info based on your specific jurisdiction, no more hours of typing into a spreadsheet!
